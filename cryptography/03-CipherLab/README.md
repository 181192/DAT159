# 03-CipherLab - Oblig02


CLI support made possibe with [PicoCLI](https://github.com/remkop/picocli). Compiled with Java 10.

Implemented help support either with `-h` or with `--help`:

```
$ java -jar target/BasicClient-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar --help
Usage: CryptoUltimate [-h] [-m=MESSAGE]
Send message with given argument
  -h, --help              display a help message
  -m, --message=MESSAGE   Message to encrypt
```


## Part 01 - Basic
This is just the standard CipherLab.zip.

> The server
```
$ java -jar target/BasicServer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Waiting for requests from client...
Connected to client at the address: /127.0.0.1
Message from DesClient: ThisIsACoolTest
Waiting for requests from client...
```

> The client
```
$ java -jar target/BasicClient-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -m ThisIsACoolTest
Connected to DesServer on localhost/127.0.0.1
Response from server: ThisIsACoolTest
```


## Part 02 - DES encryption
This is a DES implementation using ECB mode with Bounty Castle Provider and Secret Key using Java KeyStore.

> The server
```
$ java -jar target/DesServer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Waiting for requests from client...
Connected to client at the address: /127.0.0.1

Connected to DesServer on localhost/127.0.0.1
Response from server: ThisIsACoolTest
```

## Part 03 - SSL and CA
This is a SSL implementation with Certificate Authority using Java TrustStore and KeyStore.

> The server
```
$ java -jar target/SslServer-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Waiting for requests from client...
Connected to client at the address: /127.0.0.1
Message from DesClient: ThisIsACoolTest
Waiting for requests from client...
```

> The client
```
$ java -jar target/SslClient-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -m ThisIsACoolTest
